			<h1>Hi There,</h1><h4>My name is Dan!</h4>
				<p>This is my GitHub account.<a href="#">Read more about my life...</a></p>

			<ol><li>What is a Git?</li>
				<dl>"Git is a mature, actively maintained open source project."</li>
			<li>Who started Git?</li>
				<dl>Linus Torvalds in 2005.</dl>
			<li>What is Hub?<li>
				<dl>According to github's website:</dl>
				<dl>"hub is a command line tool that wraps git in order to extend it</dl>
				<dl>with extra features and commands that make working with GitHub easier.</dl>
			<li>Describe Repository and its role?</li>
				<dl>Refers to a central place where data is stored and maintained.</dl>
				<dl>Can be a place where multiple databases or files are located for distribution over a network.</dl>
			<li>Your thoughts about GitHub?</li>
				<dl>As a first time user, wow. The capabilities of essentially cloud code writing could accelerate the speed of development even faster than currently.</dl>
				<dl>It keeps a use-by-use account of every change made done to a project file, so when I initially used Ms. Ison's personal HTML code, it had</dl>
				<dl>stored instances of the code prior to my multiple edits. Theoretically, since my Repository is public, someone could see the initial code used by her.</dl>
				<dl>Could this also help in code stealing/plagiarizing? I could see that application as well.</dl>
